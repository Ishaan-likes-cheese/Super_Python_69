#SINCE CODE READS FROM UP TO DOWN THE VARIABLES CAN BE CHANGED ACCORDINGLY!

print("Whats is your name?")

#YOU CAN ALSO PUT name = input("Enter your name":) AND enter your name will be displayed
print("Well hello, " + name)

#WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF INPUT WAS INPUTTED
#THERE ARE INTEGERS, FLOATS, STRINGS, AND BOOLEANS
#ONLY NUMBERS CAN BE CHANGED INTO FLOATS USING THE float() function
